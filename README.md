This is a reimplementation of [the official Android frontend of 无可奉告](https://github.com/TairanHe/SJTU-Anonymous_Forum), with the following improvements:

+ A more concise structure in pure Kotlin
+ A more stable and fast behavior thanks to Android's [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and Kotlin's [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)
+ A more concise UI design
+ More fluent animations and transitions
+ Closer to Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/)
