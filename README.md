# Anonymous

This is a reimplementation of [the official Android frontend of 无可奉告](https://github.com/TairanHe/SJTU-Anonymous_Forum), with the following improvements:

+ A more concise and stable project structure, especially in the UI updating logic
+ A more concise UI design
+ More fluent animations and transitions
+ Closer to Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/)

Note that this repo is currently **unofficial**, which

+ May lack some detailed functions
+ Have not been fully tested

### Major known issues

+ New post sometimes do not work properly, which may tell you "发送成功" even when it actually fails

Feel free to post your ideas in the Github [issue](https://github.com/wu-qing-157/Anonymous/issues) page.
But remember that this repo is *unofficial* and in *alpha-alpha* test stage.

### Future

If some *major* change to 无可奉告 is needed in the future:

+ Changes will be made only to this implementation
+ This implementation will be set as the official one

### Releases

Please refer to the GitHub [release](https://github.com/wu-qing-157/Anonymous/releases) page.

This repo is in *alpha-alpha* test stage, so currently has no releases.
There will be some *alpha* releases as an unofficial implementation in the future.
